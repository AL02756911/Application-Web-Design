# What is Markdown?  

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to create formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is widely used because of its simplicity, allowing users to focus on writing without being overwhelmed by complex formatting.  

Markdown files are often used for:  

- Writing documentation for software projects.  
- Creating README files for GitHub repositories.  
- Formatting plain text for blogs, notes, or articles.  
- Converting text into HTML for websites.
